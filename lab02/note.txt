Report:
- dataset ok
- Sobel + DBScan is a fair solution for the task but no neural net -> can't be tested with our script
- Analysis of hyperparameters not present
- What metrics did you use to validate your results?

Code: ok but no neural network
Line detection accuracy: could not run the tests due to errors in the students' code (Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead)
Reproducibility: no packages version in the requirements file
Compliance with instructions: expecting incorrect input shape
